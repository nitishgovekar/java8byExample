Stream anyMatch(Predicate predicate) returns whether any elements of this stream match the provided predicate. It may not evaluate the predicate on all elements if not necessary for determining the result. This is a short-circuiting terminal operation. A terminal operation is short-circuiting if, when presented with infinite input, it may terminate in finite time.
