Filter : 
Stream filter(Predicate predicate) returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream that match the given predicate. This is an intermediate operation. These operations are always lazy i.e, executing an intermediate operation such as filter() does not actually perform any filtering, but instead creates a new stream that, when traversed, contains the elements of the initial stream that match the given predicate.
